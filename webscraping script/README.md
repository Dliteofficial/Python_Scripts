## Details of the Project

### Description
This is a simple webscraping script that scrapes the details of each book listed on [Book to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com/). There are 1000 books there and I have decided to take things up a notch by scraping the title, price and availability of the book and writing it to a .md file which can be found [here](Result.md).

### Tools Used
- Selenium
- XPATH
- Tabulate
- [XPather](https://www.xpather.com/)
